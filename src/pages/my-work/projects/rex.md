## What it is

The flagship product at rexlabs, the CRM for real estate agencies. It allows them (beyond other things) to manage their contacts, properties and listings, deal with contracts and financials as well as actually exporting the data to public portals in Australia, New Zealand and now also the UK.

## What did I do

It is this recent expansion that made us rethink how we would approach bringing this legacy application into the new era technology wise. The old Frontend is written in PHP (server side rendered), jQuery and KnockoutJS.

As the lead of the Frontend team (9 developers), I was in charge of planning this process as well as the actual feature development for the UK expansion.

This included a rebuild of the core app architechture (or rather built on top), to allow us to introduce our green field React stack into the product without disruptions. It also needed to allow us to replace parts of the app one by one without having to rewrite the whole thing in one go.

Beyond the technical lead, I was also responsible for planning and executing sprints, report delivery and management of communications between teams (Frontend, Backend, and Design). I also ensured the quality of our work through organised code reviews and QA processes.

Technology stack used:

- React
- Redux
- CSS-in-JS
- JS
- webpack
- babel
- storybook
- yarn workspaces
- KnockoutJS
- PHP
- gulp
