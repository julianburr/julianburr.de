## What it is

Pocket is the mobile version of [Rex](../rex/), a CRM for real estate agencies. It is built in React Native, using the existing API that serves the web application.

## What did I do

As part of the Frontend team I was involved in planning the architechture of the application, as well as its screens and components. This was with early days React Native, before [Expo] etc. became a thing, which lead to extra challenges when it came to improving DX (it was also before storybook properly supported RN) and other things.

We managed to successfully deliver a large scale RN app to an existing user base, that is now part of the daily business for many of our clients.

Application stack:

- React Native (iOS and Android)
- Redux & Redux Forms
- ImmutableJS
