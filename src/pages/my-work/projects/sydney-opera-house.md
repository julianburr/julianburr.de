## What it is

The Sydney Opera House is one of the most iconic buildings in the world. While working for Sapient Nitro in Sydney I was part of the project that was dealing with the re-design of the public website as well as the ticket booking workflow.

## What did I do

I was the lead Frontend developer of the project, leading a team of 5 offshore developers in India, including regular phone and video conferences to manage and delegate work.

My main responsibility besides leading the FE development was building the actual fundamentals for this redesign, creating style guides, prototypes and templates for the new website, including the ticket booking section. This included working together with the design team as well as the Backend team for the final integration into the CRM.
