## What did I do

As the lead developer of the project, I was responsible for the Frontend development (with a team of 7 developers) and overseing the backend side of things (with a team of 4 developers working on the product).

The frontend was built with a modern React stack, heaviy building on and extending the [whitebranded component library](../vivid/) we built for [Hitch](../hitch/).

The frontend stack of this product includes:

- JS
- webpack
- babel
