A co-worker shared this crazy codepen today: [https://codepen.io/tomhodgins/pen/ErqeXm](https://codepen.io/tomhodgins/pen/ErqeXm). In it, it shows the usage of css selectors on Javascript objects ðŸ¤¯

The example:

```js
import cssMatch from "https://tomhodgins.github.io/espath/css-match.js";

const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

cssMatch(data, ":nth-of-type(odd)"); // = [1, 3, 5]
cssMatch(data, ":nth-of-type(even)"); // = [2, 4]
```

But how does it work? It uses the [espath](https://github.com/tomhodgins/espath) library, more specifically [the css match method of that library](https://github.com/tomhodgins/espath#bonus-round-css-selectors) under the hood.

espath turns the object into micoxml and then into DOM nodes, which then can be queries via XPath or, as we see above, CSS selectors. Pretty neat ðŸ˜Š
