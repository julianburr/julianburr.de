title: No, I Don't Have Imposter Syndrom

It's nothing that I learned today, so it's probably a bit misplaced here, but it's something I feel very strongly about personally. And I thought I share it, maybe I'm not the only one who feels that way, who knows...

A bit of background: I'm a software developer, that started as a full stack and over time and different employments through my career moved more and more into frontend, where I am right now, leading a team of 10 other frontend developers at rexlabs.

I've been very lucky a lot of the time, getting opportunities because I was at the right place at the right time, working for and with people of all trades that not only taught me a lot of the professional skills that I have today, but also how the Industrie works and even more on a personal level. All in all I think I've been very privileged throughout my career so far, and I'm grateful for that.

On the other end I also did a lot for being where I am now. I work hard, don’t mind going the extra mile, doing long hours and weekends, mainly because I’m passionate about what I’m doing and the goals I’m working towards. Also, more than anything, I’m hungry to learn. To the point where it almost becomes a problem, where I’m getting bored and demotivated really quickly whenever I have the feeling I’m not learning anything new. Yeah, patients is definitely not one of my strongest traits. But I embrace my hunger for knowledge. And this is where all of this starts.

## Praise everywhere

I like solving problems, many of us do. People around me think I’m exceptionally good at it, always complementing my work and way of working. And that’s great, I appreciate and respect them for that, but I don’t always agree. I don’t think I am better than average in most of what I’m doing. Mostly because I don’t do anything special, I have no special education (I didn’t study after highschool, cause ironically school and the way you learn there was never my thing), I don’t have exceptionally deep knowledge in any specific field, or anything like that.

Besides that, my eagerness to learn also means that I have the constant urge to do better. Better than I did last time. Raising my own bar more and more as I go. This means I never really reach it, but that’s fine. Actually no, it better, it’s what drives me.

## Imposter everywhere

The reactions when people see me, trying to explain this, are usually the same. It’s a common reaction to just put it aside as imposter syndrom, and I don’t blame them. I still see it as a kind of compliment. Essentially they are just saying “I think you are really good, and your inability to see that seems wrong to me”. And I do think most people are honest when they say that, so I appreciate that they acknowledge my work … and move on.

But the fact is, I don’t have imposter syndrom. At least I like to think that.

In my view imposter means feeling not worthy of where you are in life, feeling not good enough for the people around you and the ones you work for or maybe are responsible for. But this is barely the case for me.

Yes, it’s true, I don’t think I’m special in any way. But that’s just a realistic view on live. Pretty much everyone around me can or could do what I do, and that’s what drives me as a team lead, making others aware of that. There is not much reason to look up to me, in fact by doing so you pretend it’s something extraordinary, instead of striving to learn how to do the same (in your own context). So I’d rather focus on the latter for the people I mentor.

And yes, it’s also true that I (pretty much constantly) think that I’m not good enough. But not for the people around me!But for me. And that’s an important difference. The reason I think I’m not great at what I do is not because I feel like I let anyone else down. I actually think I’m doing a great job most of the time from the perspective of my employers, usually going the extra mile and solving problems they didn’t even know had meaningful impact while still focusing on the priorities everyone agreed to. But, and that’s the big but, I don’t think I reached full potential yet.

## Trying to peak over the bar

I don’t think I do great, because the way I see it it would mean I wouldn’t need to try harder next time. And that’s my main drive. As I explained in the beginning, whatever I’m doing is usually accompanied by the feeling that I need to learn, to improve. Not only do I want to do better next time, I also want to know how I would do it during the first time. And that means looking at the flaws and imperfections. But in my opinion that’s good, how else can you improve and avoid them next time if you don’t (honest to yourself) point them out.

It’s not imposter syndrom, I don’t feel I don’t belong here and I don’t feel I’m not good enough to be here, but I feel I can be better. No. I know I can be better. And I know I want to be better. And I want to learn. And grow as a professional and much more than that as a person.

I don’t know if any of that makes any sense to anyone else. But with all of it being said, I also want to highlight that just because I don’t think it’s imposter syndrom, I still agree that the way I look at things might not be the healthiest. I often envy people who can do a thing and look at it with pride afterwards, rather than with disgust looking underneath the carpet at all the dead bodies that got buried along the way. I don’t, in any way, want to convince anyone to approach things the way I do. This is not the point of me writing this.

## So why did I write this?

Because I think it’s important (maybe more to me than to anyone) that others can see the difference. Whenever people put the “imposter syndrom” stamp on me it always comes with a lot of sympathy. Which is great, I think people that actually do suffer from it should get this support and more of it.

But when it comes to me, that sympathy and feeling you need to help me is simply misplaced. All I have are (unreachable) high expectations to myself, but they help me, drive me to grow. They are what brought me here in the first place, and I want to embrace that for as long as I can.

And I am longing for people helping me do this. Whenever people simplify my feeling as just being imposter syndrom, for me it also means they potentially hold back meaningful criticism that would help me improve, because that's what you should do in that situation. And again, I don't think that's a bad thing per se, it's probably better to be safe than sorry. But often I remain behind, wishing that people gave me honest feedback to my work including everything that wasn't great, helping me to do better next time.
