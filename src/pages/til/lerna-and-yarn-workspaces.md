With our [component library at rexlabs](../../my-work/projects/vivid/) I have to deal with mono repos on a daily basis. Actually, many of our products are set up as mono repos, allowing us to maintain multiple apps belonging to the same product in one place (source control wise). This also means I had to deal a lot with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/), these are some thoughts and takeaways from that.

At this stage I also want to give a huge shout out to [Lochlan Bunn](https://twitter.com/loklaan), who's been teaching me and the rest of the team all of this when I started at [rexlabs](https://rexlabs.io) ðŸ™Œ

## What is yarn workspaces?

Yarn comes with a great feature out of the box: workspaces. These are essentially what mono repos are, you have one repo with a lot of sub repos (= workspaces). In FE context these could e.g. all be individual npm packages, but for the sake of maintanance and setup its easier to have them in one github repository.

Popular examples for the use of mono repos (and yarn workspaces) are [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/), [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) and a lot of others.

Yarn workspaces helps you with this kind of architechture. Every sub repo has its own package json, but a lot of the dependencies are usually the same, so you get a lot of extra bloat. Through workspaces yarn can manage that, hoisting all shared dependencies up into the root of your repo. It can also identify linkages between your own packages, meaning if one of you sub repos depends on another one of you sub repos in the same mono repo, yarn will symlink these for you, making development inside the mono repo a hell of a lot easier.

So what do you need to do to use workspaces? Not much!

```yaml
// package.json in the root of your project
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "mono-repo-example",
  "workspaces": ["workspace-a", "workspace-b"]
}
```

In a more realistic example, you'll probably have a subfolder for all your packages in the mono repo, so you'd do something like this:

```yaml
// package.json in the root of your project
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "mono-repo-example",
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
}
```

And that's it, really. As far as workspaces are concerned, at least.

## So how does Lerna fit into this?

First of all, Lerna used to be the go to tool before yarn workspaces became a thing, dealing with exactly the same issue yarn does now (e.g. dependency linking and hoisting). However, unlike some people think, Lerna is not obsolete now that this can be handled much easier with workspaces.

Lerna still comes in handy whenever you actually want to do something with your packages. Be it publishing them, running test or any other arbitrary scripts over them. You name it. Lerna actually ties in really well **with** yarn workspaces, making the setup as simple as this:

```yaml
// lerna.json
{
  "packages": ["packages/*"],
  "version": "independent",
  "npmClient": "yarn",
  "useWorkspaces": true
}
```

```yaml
// package.json in the root of your project
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "mono-repo-example",
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "scripts": {
    "test": "lerna run test --stream", // runs "test" script in all packages
    "publish-all": "lerna publish" // starts publish flow for all changed packages
  }
}
```

Really recommend reading the documentation in the github repo for more details ðŸ˜Š
