Just a personal realisation. It might be obvious, but it's too easy to forget about it or push it aside in the heat of the battle.

I tend to over-commit to my work. Partially because I'm a perfectionist, partially because I'm lucky enough that my work overlaps with my passion and what I enjoy doing, so it's sometimes hard to know when to stop.

After resigning from my last role at rexlabs (after several burnouts) I decided to take some time off, not only away from work but also away from programming (at least for a bit).

I can't state enough how important it is to take good care of your mental health. Even just a few weeks in, taking a proper break makes such a huge difference for me personally, not comparible to any time off or holiday I could have taken while still employed.

At the same time, you don't need to quit your job. Do whatever helps you if you start feeling burned out or anxious at work. It might be a hobby, it might just be a clearer split between work and life. Whatever works for you, take the time for it!
