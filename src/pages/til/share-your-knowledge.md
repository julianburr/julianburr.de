Well, this is basically the whole point of this part of my website, but it's still worth explaining why I do this.

In general, I am constantly driven by knowledge, trying to learn and improve whenever I can. It also means I get bored very quickly, even worse: whenever I feel like I'm not learning something, I get anxious.

All of this leads to me constantly looking for things to learn and improve in. But what to do with that new gained knowledge. In my opinion the most powerful thing about knowledge is that you can share it with others. Besides that I found that most of the time the knowledge starts off as being very surface level, until I start sharing it with other, which is when it starts to deepen. You start to question things, look closer at the matter, have to explain it. Sharing your knowledge will improve your knowledge of the thing itself in the process.

But beyond all of this, the main reason why I have this section on my website and why I recommend everyone to do something similar (no matter if public or just for yourself) is for awareness. As I said, I quickly get into a state where I feel like I stagnate, not learning anything anymore. But this is rarely true. There are so many small things we learn on an everyday basis. And I personally never realised this until I kept track of it.

So go ahead, keep notes or your thoughts and TIL moments somewhere accessible, you won't regret it ðŸ˜Š
