Long story short, this is another one of these "nothing special and a lot of people probably already know about it" things that just blew my mind when I found out about it ðŸ˜…

## Install it

```bash
brew install tree
```

## Use it

```bash
tree --help

# e.g. list current directory 3 levels deep
tree . -L 3
```

You can read more about it here: https://rschu.me/list-a-directory-with-tree-command-on-mac-os-x-3b2d4c4a4827. I'm definitely going to use it frequently for library readmes etc. ðŸ“š
