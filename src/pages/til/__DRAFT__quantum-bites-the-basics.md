This post is part of a series of posts, all around my learnings about quantum computing. The main goal, like with all of the other TIL posts, is for me to deepen my understanding by writing notes of my learnings down. I still hope that as a side effect these notes will be helpful to others that are trying to learn about the same topics ðŸ˜„

That being said, I have no background in quantum physics or any of the related fields, so there is a good chance that my understanding especially in the beginning is simplified or plain wrong, so take everything with a grain of salt ðŸ™ƒ

Quantum Bites:

1. The basics - what's the difference between quantum and classical computing?
1. The applications - what are the main use cases for quantum computers?
1. The competition - who are the main competitors building quantum computers?
