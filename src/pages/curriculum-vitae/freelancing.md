While working at [Expeedo](../expeedo/), as well as during my time travelling Asia and Australia in 2014 and 2015, I worked as a freelancing web designer and developer. As such, I worked on a variaty of different projects, usually ranging from initial planning, through designing the website or application to implementing it using HTML, CSS and JS and integrating it into a suitable CMS (usually Wordpress for basic website, some projects however required more specialised software) using PHP.

Freelancing, espacially in the early stage of my career, gave me an oportunity to improve my skills in areas I wasn't able to at my fulltime role, as well as experiment with new technologies without having to commit to them. This helped me a lot developing that constant drive for learning something new that I have today.
