[Rexlabs](https://rexlabs.io) is a product company based in Brisbane, Queensland. While the main product is still [Rex](https://www.rexsoftware.com), a CRM for real estate agencies, the company has transitioned more into a product house, launching other products like [Hitch](../../my-work/projects/hitch/) and [Spoke](../../my-work/projects/spoke/).

## My Responsibilities

I started as part of the Frontend team, but quickly transitioned into more of a lead role, eventually becoming the technical lead of the FE development team.

Responsibilities include planning and development of new products, as well as features for existing ones. As team lead I am also handling common project management tasks, planning and executing sprints, delegating work across the team and ensuring output quality through regular code reviews and QA. For more specific details on some of the recent projects check out my [work examples section](../../my-work/).

Beyond the product work I was also part of the core team building our current Frontend stack, including the [generic design system and component library](../../my-work/projects/vivid/). A big part of my role is to constantly think about how to improve the product quality and developer experience at rexlabs.

I am also directly involved in hiring, leading interviews with FE and fullstack candidates. This helped me a lot in my communication skills, dealing with people and having to understand what their motivations and goals are to be able to evaluate whether or not they are a good fit for the team and the company.

To further improve these and my mentoring skills, I started to be more active in the JS community, giving [regular talks] at the local React meetup and recently trying to start [writing blog articles]. Personally, sharing topics that way always helps me understanding them better in the core, helping not only others but even more myself in the process.
