[Rexlabs](https://rexlabs.io) is a product company based in Brisbane, Queensland. While the main product is still [Rex](https://www.rexsoftware.com), a CRM for real estate agencies, during my time there the company has transitioned more into a product house, launching other products like Hitch, a referral system application, and [Spoke](../../my-work/projects/spoke/), an avertising platform for real estate agencies.

## My Responsibilities

As part of the Frontend team I learned a lot about product development, especially in React and React Native. I eventually transitioned into the role of the technical lead of the team.

Responsibilities included planning and development of new products, as well as features for existing ones. As team lead I was also handling common project management tasks, planning and executing sprints, delegating work across the team and ensuring output quality through regular code reviews and QA. I was responsible for mentoring and training the Frontend team, as well as doing regular performance reviews.

For more specific details on some of the recent projects check out my [work examples section](../../my-work/). Beyond the product work I was also part of the core team building our current Frontend stack (championing areas like testing, accessibility, performance, etc.), including the [component library and eventually design system](../../my-work/projects/vivid-and-luna/). A big part of my role was to constantly think about how to improve the product quality and developer experience at rexlabs.

I was also directly involved in hiring, leading interviews with FE and full-stack candidates. This helped me a lot in my communication skills and understanding people's motivations and goals are to be able to evaluate whether or not they are a good fit for the team and the company.

To further improve these and my mentoring skills, I started to be more active in the JS community, giving [regular talks](../../my-work/) at the local React meetup and recently trying to start [writing blog articles](../../my-work/). Personally, sharing topics that way always helps me understanding them better in the core, helping not only others but even more myself in the process.
